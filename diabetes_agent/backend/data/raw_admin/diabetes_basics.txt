# Example Diabetes Knowledge Document

## What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues, and it's your brain's main source of fuel.

## Types of Diabetes

### Type 1 Diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where your pancreas produces little to no insulin. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence but can occur at any age.

### Type 2 Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form. Your body doesn't use insulin properly (insulin resistance), and your pancreas can't make enough insulin to overcome this resistance.

### Gestational Diabetes
This type occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves after delivery, but increases risk of Type 2 diabetes later.

## Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes

- Being overweight or obese
- Physical inactivity
- Family history of diabetes
- Age (risk increases after 45)
- High blood pressure
- Abnormal cholesterol levels
- History of gestational diabetes

### Normal Ranges
- Fasting blood sugar: 70-99 mg/dL
- After meals (2 hours): Less than 140 mg/dL
- HbA1c: Below 5.7%

### Prediabetes
- Fasting blood sugar: 100-125 mg/dL
- HbA1c: 5.7% to 6.4%

### Diabetes
